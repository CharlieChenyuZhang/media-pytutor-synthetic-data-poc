### Summary of CIS 3260 – Final Exam Content

The CIS 3260 Final Exam is designed to assess students' understanding of key programming concepts in Python, focusing on foundational programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Here’s an organized summary of the main topics covered:

#### Part 1 – Multiple Choice
- **Understanding Functions and Return Statements**
  - Students are tested on the purpose of `return` statements and variable scopes (`local vs. global`).
- **Loop Mechanics**
  - Questions include evaluating the correct syntax and logic for loops, especially in calculating series like `1/2 + 2/3 + ... + 99/100`.
- **String Manipulation**
  - An example focusing on the use of the `.split()` method and string properties.
- **Data Structures**
  - Accessing elements in lists and understanding list position/indexing.
- **Function Definitions**
  - Recognizing valid function headers and expected functionality.

#### Exam Questions
- **Code Evaluation**
  - Students analyze given code snippets to predict outputs, reinforcing understanding of loops, variable reassignment, and flow control.
- **String and Character Properties**
  - Evaluating character encoding (Unicode) and string operations.

#### Part 2 – Fill in the Blanks
- **String Functions and Conditions**
  - Tests knowledge on specific string methods (e.g., `.isdigit()`, `.count()`) and list operations (e.g., `len()`, `max()`).
- **Variable Manipulation**
  - Students may need to demonstrate manipulating list data structures and checking for values within them.

#### Software Development – Part 3
1. **Digit Counting Program**
   - Develop a program to count digits in a string and analyze inputs and outputs, emphasizing user interaction and string manipulation.
2. **Leap Year Calculation**
   - Using logical conditions to determine leap years within a specified range, highlighting control flow and boolean expressions alongside understanding years and iterations.
3. **Stock Price Analysis Tool**
   - Students will develop a program to handle user input and compute averages and maximums. This assesses their ability to use lists and perform basic statistical operations on data.

### Learning Objectives:
- **Functionality and Problem-Solving in Python**
  - Students will learn to use Python functions, lists, and control structures to solve practical problems.
- **Code Analysis and Debugging**
  - The exam tasks students to debug codes and understand the logical flow of programming constructs.
- **String and List Manipulation**
  - A focus on handling string methods and list operations reflects real-world programming tasks.

Overall, the exam incorporates practical programming tasks with theoretical questioning, promoting a comprehensive understanding of Python fundamentals essential for beginners.
