## Summary of Quizzes/Exams for Introductory Programming Course

### General Purpose
The quizzes/exams are designed to assess students' understanding of fundamental programming concepts, particularly focusing on string manipulation, control flow structures, and the behavior of various Python statements.

### Main Topics Covered

1. **String Methods and Properties:**
   - Understanding how to use `startswith()` to check the beginning of a string.
   - Differentiating between string and integer data types, particularly recognizing that variables can reference different types of objects.
   - Manipulating and accessing string contents through indexing and slicing.
   - Using built-in string functions such as `len()`, `count()`, and `isalpha()`.

2. **Loops and Control Flow:**
   - Analyzing the behavior of `while` loops, including conditions that are evaluated at various points in the loop.
   - Understanding the `for` loop structure and its function in iterating over a range.
   - Determining the output of loop constructs based on their logic and iteration limits.

### Critical Details

- **String Operations:**
  - Students learn to extract characters and substrings from strings, as well as how to repeat strings and count occurrences of characters.
  
- **Loop Mechanics:**
  - Students evaluate when loop conditions are true and understand the importance of incrementing counters to control loop execution.
  - The distinction between inclusive and exclusive ranges in loops, specifically how `range(start, stop)` operates.

Through these quizzes, students are encouraged to apply their knowledge in practical scenarios, solidifying their understanding of how basic programming constructs operate in Python.
