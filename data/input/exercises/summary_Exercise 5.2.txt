### Summary of In-Class Exercise 5.2

**Objective:** The exercise aims to reinforce the concept of control structures in programming by using loops and conditionals.

**Key Topics Covered:**
1. **Input Handling**: Students will practice taking multiple inputs using the `input()` function.
2. **Variables**: Understanding the use of variables to store values (e.g., `number` and `max`).
3. **While Loop**: Utilizing a loop to repeatedly execute code as long as a condition is true.
4. **Conditional Statements**: Employing an `if` statement to compare values and determine the maximum number.
5. **Output**: Using the `print()` function to display results based on the programâ€™s logic.

**Critical Details:**
- The code snippet initializes `max` with the first input number.
- It utilizes a while loop to continue accepting input until `0` is entered, at which point the loop terminates.
- Inside the loop, it updates the `max` variable to keep track of the largest number entered by the user.
- The results printed at the end include the maximum value found (`max`) and the last entered number (`number`).

This exercise is designed to enhance students' understanding of basic programming constructs and their practical applications.
