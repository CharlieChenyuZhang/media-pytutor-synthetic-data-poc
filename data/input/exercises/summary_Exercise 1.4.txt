## Summary of In-Class Exercise 1.4

**Objective**: The exercise aims to reinforce understanding of error identification and correction in Python programming.

**Tasks**: 
1. Participants are required to create a Python program named `test.py`, containing five specific lines of code.
2. Students will run their program and then address three questions related to error detection.

**Main Topics Covered**:
- **Error Identification**: Students will need to determine how many errors are present in the provided code and classify their types.
- **Types of Errors**:
   - Syntax errors (e.g., incorrect function names)
   - Runtime errors (e.g., division by zero)
- **Error Correction**: Participants will learn how to fix each identified error.

**Critical Details**:
- The five lines of code include a mix of print statements and invalid operations that will trigger various errors.
- This exercise encourages hands-on debugging and improves problem-solving skills in Python.

By completing this exercise, students will strengthen their ability to read and troubleshoot code effectively.
