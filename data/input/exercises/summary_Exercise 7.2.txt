### Summary of In-Class Exercise 7.2 on Lists in an Introductory Programming Course

**General Purpose:**
The exercise aims to reinforce the students' understanding of list indexing, list operations, and basic list manipulation in the context of Python programming.

**Main Topics Covered:**

1. **Negative Indexing:**
   - The students are prompted to determine the output of accessing an element using a negative index in a list. In this case, they analyze `list1[-1]` to find the last item of the list.

2. **List Multiplication:**
   - The second question requires students to understand what happens when a list is multiplied by an integer in Python, specifically how it concatenates the list to itself.

3. **Accessing List Elements:**
   - Students practice retrieving specific elements from a list by writing statements to display the first three elements of a predefined list.

4. **Checking for Value in List:**
   - The exercise also focuses on using a statement to check for the existence of a specific value within a list.

5. **Updating a List:**
   - Finally, students learn how to add elements to a list and display the updated list contents.

**Critical Details:**
- Understanding indexing (both positive and negative).
- The mechanics of list multiplication and its resulting structure.
- Practical statements for accessing and modifying lists.
- Using the `in` keyword to check for the presence of an item in a list.

This exercise promotes hands-on practice of these concepts, helping students internalize foundational programming skills with lists in Python.
