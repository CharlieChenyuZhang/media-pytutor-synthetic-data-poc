### Summary of In-Class Exercise 6.6 for Introductory Programming Course

#### General Purpose:
The exercise focuses on reinforcing key programming concepts related to function design, list manipulation, and counting occurrences in a dataset using Python. It encourages students to practice function implementation, system design diagrams, and coding fundamentals.

#### Main Topics Covered:
1. **Function Stubs**: Understanding the concept of a stub as a simple but incomplete version of a function.
   - Correct answer for objective: A. A stub

2. **Program Analysis**: Students are required to analyze the provided program `CountLettersInList.py`, marking function calls in red.

3. **System Design Diagrams**: A reverse engineering task where students create a system design diagram by interpreting the code.

4. **Random Character Generation**: Introduction to creating a list of random lowercase letters and utilizing a custom module (`RandomCharacter`).

5. **Counting and Displaying Data**: Exercises focusing on defining functions to:
   - Create an empty list of randomly generated characters.
   - Display characters in specified formatting (20 per line).
   - Count occurrences of each letter in the character list.
   - Display the counts in a structured format.

#### Critical Details:
- **Function Definitions**: The exercise includes code snippets for function implementation, demonstrating how to create lists, count letter occurrences, and format outputs:
  - `main()` function orchestrates the program flow.
  - Functions like `createList()`, `displayList(chars)`, `countLetters(chars)`, and `displayCounts(counts)` are elaborated to guide students through the necessary programming constructs.
  
- **Code Implementation**: Students are encouraged to write specific functions that handle distinct tasks, promoting modular programming practices and enhancing code readability.

This exercise serves as an interactive way to instill programming logic, function handling, and data manipulation skills in an introductory context.
