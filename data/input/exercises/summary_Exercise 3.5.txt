### Summary of In-Class Exercise 3.5 for Introductory Programming Course

**Objective:** The exercise focuses on implementing a program that evaluates body temperature, applying concepts of decision-making in programming.

**Topics Covered:**
1. **Input and Output Analysis:**
   - The program requires input of body temperature in Fahrenheit.
   - It outputs a message indicating whether there is a fever or not based on the input temperature.

2. **Two-Way Decision Selection:**
   - The exercise emphasizes the use of a two-way decision structure (if-else statement) to determine the output.
   - A condition is established where if the input temperature exceeds 100.4Â°F, the program will display "Fever!" Otherwise, it will display "No fever." This condition is articulated using a Boolean expression.

3. **System Design:**
   - The students are guided to outline the logical steps to process input and generate output, ensuring a clear understanding of the programming flow from input to result.

4. **Program Development:**
   - Finally, participants are tasked with writing the actual code in Python, enabling them to apply their understanding of the discussed concepts in a practical manner.

This exercise enhances students' comprehension of decision-making constructs and reinforces the fundamental programming skills required to develop functional applications.
