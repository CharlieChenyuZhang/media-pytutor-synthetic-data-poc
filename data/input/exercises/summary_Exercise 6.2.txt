**Summary of In-Class Exercise 6.2 - Introductory Programming Course**

**General Purpose:**
The purpose of Exercise 6.2 is to reinforce students' understanding of function definitions, headers, parameters, and return values in programming, aligning with the objectives of this week's lecture.

**Main Topics Covered:**

1. **Function Header Components:**
   - Students are quizzed on what constitutes the header of a function, with options provided including the function name and parameter list.

2. **Function Characteristics:**
   - Definition of functions is explored, specifically regarding the number of parameters a function can have and the necessity of return statements.

3. **Function Definition Practice:**
   - An exercise requires students to write a function definition that processes an integer parameter and returns its double.

4. **Function Header Creation:**
   - Students are tasked with creating headers for various functions, focusing on practical applications:
     - **Sales Commission Calculation:** Taking sales amount and commission rate as parameters.
     - **Calendar Printing:** Inputting month and year to produce a calendar.
     - **Square Root Calculation:** Function for computing a square root.

**Critical Details:**
- Understanding the difference between a function's name, parameters, and return value is emphasized.
- Practical exercises test both theoretical knowledge and coding skills relevant to function creation and manipulation in programming. 

This exercise facilitates hands-on learning about key programming concepts that are foundational for developing functional code.
