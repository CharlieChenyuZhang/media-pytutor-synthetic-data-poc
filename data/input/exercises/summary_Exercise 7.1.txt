**Summary of In-Class Exercise for Introductory Programming Course: Exercise 7.1**

**Objectives:**
The exercise addresses three key objectives (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) related to the use of lists in programming.

**Topics Covered:**

1. **Project Topics Discussion:**
   Students are tasked with discussing their project proposals, specifically evaluating whether lists should be utilized in the following project ideas:
   - **A student health program**: Tracks daily health status.
   - **Text-based online banking system**: Manages user accounts and transactions.
   - **Contact Book**: Stores information for digital device users.
   - **Gift Recommendation program**: Provides gift suggestions based on user preferences.
   - **Password generator**: Creates secure passwords.
   - **Rock, Paper, Scissors game**: Implements the classic game with user input.

2. **Creating and Analyzing Lists:**
   Students create two separate lists:
   - **List of Company Names**: Includes major tech companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM).
   - **List of Stock Prices**: Corresponding prices of those companies (340.5, 400, 230, 198).
   
   Students are required to display:
   - **Maximum stock price**: Identifying the highest value in the stock prices list.
   - **Minimum stock price**: Identifying the lowest value in the stock prices list.
   - **Number of companies**: Counting the entries in the company names list.
   - **Sum of stock prices**: Calculating the total of all stock prices listed.

This exercise aims to reinforce the understanding of lists in programming, their practical applications in project development, and basic operations such as finding maximum, minimum, and summing elements within lists.
