### Summary of In-Class Exercise 3.1

#### Objective:
The purpose of this exercise is to apply basic programming concepts by taking two numbers as input, calculating their sum, and evaluating various conditions related to that sum.

#### Topics Covered:
1. **Input Handling**: Students will learn how to gather user input through the `input()` function and convert it to integers using `int()`.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: The exercise involves simple arithmeticâ€”specifically, calculating the sum of two numbers.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Students will utilize conditional logic to check:
   - If the sum is greater than 5
   - If the sum equals 5
   - If the sum is less than 5
   - If the sum is odd
4. **Printing Output**: Students will practice displaying results using the `print()` function.

#### Critical Details:
- Students must complete the provided code by filling in specific blanks to implement the necessary calculations and evaluations.
- The logical checks require a fundamental understanding of operators such as `>`, `<`, `==`, and the modulus operator to determine odd/even status.
- This exercise reinforces the students' understanding of control flow in programming through the evaluation of conditions based on user input. 

This aligns with the foundational skills expected from an introductory programming course, fostering both practical coding abilities and critical thinking in problem-solving.
