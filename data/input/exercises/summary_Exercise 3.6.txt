### Summary of In-Class Exercise for Introductory Programming Course

#### General Purpose:
This in-class exercise aims to reinforce students' understanding of decision-making statements in programming, focusing on both two-way and multiple-way decision selections through practical programming tasks.

#### Topics Covered:
1. **Two-Way Decision Selection:**
   - Application of a two-way decision statement to address the vehicle recall scenario.
   - Utilization of Boolean expressions to define conditions for recalling vehicles based on model years.

2. **Multiple-Way Decision Selection:**
   - Implementation of a lottery program using multiple-way decision statements to determine award amounts based on user input.

#### Critical Details:
1. **Vehicle Recall Program:**
   - **Input:** A model year entered by the user.
   - **Output:** A message indicating if there is a recall ("Please recall!" for years 1995-1998 and 2004-2006; "No need for a recall" otherwise).
   - **Condition Representation:** Use a Boolean expression to check if the model year falls within the specified ranges.
   - **Control Structure Used:** Two-way decision statement.

2. **Lottery System Program:**
   - **Input:** Two numbers entered by the user (guess number and lottery number).
   - **Output:** An award amount based on the distance between the guess number and the lottery number.
   - **Award Rules:**
     - $1000 for an exact match.
     - $500 if the numbers are within a distance of 2.
     - $100 if the distance is less than 6.
     - No award in other cases.
   - **Condition Representation:** Use a Boolean expression for the $500 award condition.
   - **Control Structure Used:** Multiple-way decision statement.

#### Exercise Steps:
- Analyze each system's inputs and outputs.
- Define conditions using Boolean logic for programming.
- Outline the necessary steps required to achieve the desired output based on input.
- Write the actual code to implement both scenarios.

This exercise helps students practice logical thinking and programming skills by combining theoretical knowledge with practical application.
