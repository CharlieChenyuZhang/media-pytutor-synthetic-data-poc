## Summary of In-Class Exercise 2.4

### Objective:
This exercise aims to reinforce understanding of basic arithmetic operations, user input handling, and output formatting in programming.

### Topics Covered:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Participants evaluate the outcome of a series of assignments and expressions involving variables.

2. **User Input and Output**:
   - Students will write a program that prompts the user for a purchase amount and calculates the associated sales tax.

3. **Formatting Output**:
   - Modification of the initial program to display the sales tax rounded to two decimal places using the `round` function.

### Details:
1. **Question on Variable Assignment**:
   - A code snippet is provided, where students need to determine the value of `x` after performing an arithmetic operation involving `y`.

2. **Sales Tax Calculation Program**:
   - Students create a program which:
     - Takes user input for a purchase amount.
     - Calculates the sales tax as 6% of that amount.
     - Outputs the calculated tax.

3. **Output Formatting Challenge**:
   - Participants are tasked with enhancing their program to present the sales tax result formatted to two decimal points, utilizing Python's `round` function for clarity in monetary values.

This exercise provides practical application of fundamental programming concepts, including variable manipulation, user interaction, and formatted output, critical for developing efficient coding skills in beginners.
