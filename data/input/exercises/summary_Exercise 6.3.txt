## Summary of In-Class Exercise for Introductory Programming Course

### General Purpose
The exercise aims to reinforce concepts from this week's lecture on function calls and parameters in programming. It provides practical applications to solidify understanding through problem-solving exercises.

### Main Topics Covered
1. **Function Invocation**: Understand how to call functions with parameters and the expected outputs.
2. **Variable Assignment**: Practice assigning the results of function calls to new variables.
3. **Control Flow**: Examine a function that uses a loop to repeat an action based on a parameter.
4. **Error Identification**: Analyze code for potential mistakes and logical errors.

### Critical Details
- **Exercise 6.3**:
    - **Question 1**: Involves a function `add` which sums two integers. Students must construct a statement to compute the total sales from two previously defined variables.
    - **Question 2**: Asks students to invoke a function `print_todays_date`, which takes no parameters and has no return value.
    - **Question 3**: Analyzes the output of the function `nPrint`, which prints a message a specified number of times. Students need to deduce the correct output based on the call `nPrint('a', 4)`.
    - **Question 4**: Requires students to examine a provided function for errors, specifically looking for issues in the scope of variables or uninitialized variables.

This exercise encapsulates vital programming practices, including comprehension of function behavior, variable management, and identifying code flaws, aligning with the objectives set out in the week's lecture.
