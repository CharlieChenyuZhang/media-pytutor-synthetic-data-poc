**Summary of Exercise 1.3**

This in-class exercise is designed for an introductory programming course, focusing on fundamental concepts of syntax in Python programming. The primary topics covered this week include:

1. **Syntax Errors in Print Statements**:
   - Students are tasked with identifying errors or warnings generated by various incorrect print statement formats. This includes variations where parentheses or quotation marks are omitted:
     - Examples include `print("hello"`, `print"hello")`, and `print"hello"` for parentheses, as well as `print("hello)`, `print(hello")`, and `print(hello)` for quotation marks.

2. **Basic Calculations Using the Python Interpreter**:
   - Students are encouraged to use Python as a calculator to solve practical problems:
     - Calculation of seconds in 42 minutes and 42 seconds.
     - Conversion of 10 kilometers into miles, using the conversion rate of 1.61 kilometers per mile.
     - Determination of average pace in minutes per mile and average speed in miles per hour based on the time taken to complete the 10-kilometer race.

This exercise reinforces the critical importance of syntax accuracy in programming, alongside developing basic computational skills in Python.
