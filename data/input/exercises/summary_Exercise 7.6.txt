### Summary of In-Class Exercise 7.6

**General Purpose:**  
The exercise aims to reinforce students' understanding of functions in programming by creating a function that modifies a list by removing its first and last elements.

**Main Topics Covered:**  
1. **Function Definition:** Students learn to define a function using the specified header: `def chop(lst)`.
2. **List Manipulation:** The exercise focuses on manipulating lists by removing specific elements (the first and last elements).
3. **Testing Functions:** Students are given a sample code snippet to test the functionality of their `chop` function using a predefined list.

**Critical Details:**  
- The function modifies the original list, and the expected behavior is demonstrated with the test code `t = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, followed by `chop(t)`, with the outcome being that the list `t` should be changed to `[2, 3]`.
- Understanding the distinction between modifying a list in place and returning a new list is essential for grasping list operations in programming.

This exercise enhances foundational skills in function creation and list handling, critical aspects of programming.
