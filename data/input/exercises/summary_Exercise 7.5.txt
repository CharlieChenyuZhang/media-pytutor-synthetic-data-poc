## Summary of In-Class Exercise 7.5

### General Purpose:
The purpose of this exercise is to reinforce skills in file handling and string manipulation in Python by counting specific words in a text file.

### Main Topics Covered:
1. **File Creation**: Students are tasked with creating a text file named `review.txt` containing a specific review about finger paints.
2. **Word Counting**: The main programming challenge is to write a script, `countWords.py`, that counts the occurrences of the word "well" in the `review.txt` file.
3. **Hands-On Programming Practice**: The exercise offers practical experience in using Python for file input/output operations and basic string searching techniques.

### Critical Details:
- Students should create `review.txt` with exact content provided:
  ```
  I have a niece with a lot of allergies- both foods and environmental so I was concerned about these finger paints. He did very well with them. Being 18 months old, this was a great sensory activity. Her first picture was using the blue paint- her choice. Easy clean up for mom and dad as well.
  ```
- The `countWords.py` program should correctly implement the logic to open the file, read its contents, and count how many times the word "well" appears regardless of its context in the text.

This exercise combines content creation and basic programming skills, helping students to practice and apply concepts taught in this week's lecture.
