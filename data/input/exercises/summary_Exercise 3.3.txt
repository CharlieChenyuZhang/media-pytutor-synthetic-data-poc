### Summary of In-Class Exercise for Introductory Programming Course

**Objective:** The exercise aims to reinforce students' understanding of conditional statements and their structure in programming, specifically focusing on if-elif-else constructs.

#### Topics Covered:
1. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Students are tasked with predicting the output of a program based on a given input (temperature), applying knowledge of conditional logic.

2. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The second question encourages students to analyze a code snippet for errors and understand logical ordering in conditional statements to assign grades based on a score.

#### Key Details:
- **Exercise 3.3:**
  - The first part involves determining what the code outputs based on the value of the `temperature` variable. Students must select from given options (A, B, C, D).
  
- **Code Debugging:**
  - The second part requires students to identify issues within a grading program, prompting them to recognize that the current structure will not work as intended due to incorrect grade assignment logic.

This exercise emphasizes critical thinking in programming syntax, flow control through conditional logic, and diagnosing code inefficiencies or errors.
