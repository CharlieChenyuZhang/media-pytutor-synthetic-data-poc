## Summary of In-Class Exercise 2.5 for Introductory Programming Course

### Objective:
The exercise aims to apply the software development process to a problem involving financial calculations.

### Topics Covered:
1. **System Analysis**:
   - Understanding the problem: The task is to calculate the future value of an investment based on input parameters.
   - Identifying inputs: Investment amount, annual interest rate, and duration in years.

2. **System Design**:
   - Defining the formula used for the calculation:
     - **Formula**: futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount Ã— (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ numberOfMonths
   - Breakdown of components:
     - Conversion of annual interest rate to monthly interest rate.
     - Calculation of total months from the number of years.
   - Planning the program structure to accept inputs, perform calculations, and display results.

### Key Example:
- Input: Investment amount = $1000, annual interest rate = 4.25%, years = 1.
- Output: Future investment value = $1043.33.

This exercise enhances understanding of crucial programming steps including system analysis, design principles, and applying mathematical formulas in code.
