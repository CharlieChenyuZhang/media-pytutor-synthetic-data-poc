### Summary of Lecture Slides for Introductory Programming Course - Class 3

#### Objectives
- **Chapter 2:**
  - **Augmented Assignment Operators**: Learn to simplify code using operators like `+=`.
  - **Numeric Type Conversion and Rounding**: Introduction to `round` function and type conversions.
  - **Software Development Process**: Understand the phases involved in developing a loan payment program.
  
- **Chapter 3:**
  - **Boolean Expressions**: Writing expressions using relational operators.
  - **Random Numbers Generation**: Utilizing functions like `random.randint`, `random.randrange`, and `random.random`.
  - **Selection Control**: Implementing one-way and two-way `if` statements.

#### Key Concepts Covered

1. **Augmented Assignment Operators**:
   - Combination of assignment and arithmetic operations. Example: `i += j + j * 5`.
   - A table of operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=` with equivalents is provided.

2. **Data Types and Operations**:
   - Understanding how Python recognizes types (string, integer, float).
   - Examples show type compatibility and conversion using `int()` and `float()` functions.

3. **String Conversion**:
   - Demonstrated conversion from strings to integers/floats with error handling for invalid inputs.

4. **Software Development Process**:
   - **Seven Phases**:
     1. Requirement Specification
     2. System Analysis
     3. System Design
     4. Implementation
     5. Testing
     6. Deployment
     7. Maintenance
   - Emphasis on documented requirements and iterative processes.

5. **Loan Payment Calculation Program**:
   - Formula provided for computing monthly loan payments.
   - Steps defined for software implementation, from user input to displaying results.
   - Sample Python code for computing monthly and total payments based on user inputs for interest rate, years, and loan amount.

6. **Testing the Program**:
   - Importance of verifying outputs with example test inputs to ensure correct functionality.

### Exercises
- Exercises related to the use of augmented assignment, numeric conversion, and practical applications of software development processes were included to reinforce learning objectives.

This session lays the foundation for understanding basic programming constructs, data types, and software development methodology through hands-on problem-solving with a practical example (loan payment program).
