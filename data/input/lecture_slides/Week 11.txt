### Summary of Lecture Slides for Introductory Programming Course

#### Objectives 
In this class, students will:
- Learn to invoke functions using **positional** and **keyword arguments**.
- Understand how to call functions defined in other programs.
- Apply the concept of functions in software development and design.

---

#### Main Topics Covered

1. **Function Invocation**
   - **Positional Arguments**: Arguments must match the function's parameters in order, number, and compatible type.
     - Example: Correct usage (`nPrintln("CIS", 3)`), Incorrect usages include wrong order or type mismatches.
   - **Keyword Arguments**: Arguments match the parameters by name, allowing flexibility in order.
     - Example: Correct (`nPrintln(message="CIS", n=3)`), but incorrect if number of arguments is mismatched.
   - **Combination**: You can mix positional and keyword arguments, but positional must come first.
     - Correct and incorrect examples illustrated.

2. **Using Functions from Other Programs**
   - **Importing Whole Program**: Example of importing functions from another file (module) and accessing them with dot notation.
   - **Importing Specific Functions**: Allows for direct function calls without dot notation.

3. **User-Defined Functions Benefits**
   - Code reuse, encapsulation, manageability of problems, debugging ease, and improved teamwork.

4. **Case Study: Print Calendar**
   - Introduction to creating a calendar program using a stepwise refinement approach.
   - Input prompts and output designs detailed.
   - System design diagrams and flowcharts provided to show function interactions, including reading input, printing month titles, and handling different days.
   - Concept of **stubs** for testing program framework without full implementation.

5. **Implementation Details**
   - Coding details available, featuring a structured outline of function definitions and overall program functionality.

#### Critical Details
- The importance of parameter matching in function calls: Order, number, and types must be consistent.
- How to structure a program using functions to promote clarity and modularity.
- The design process using stubs as temporary implementations to guide development.
- Basic input/output handling is crucial for user interaction in programming projects.
- Real-world applicability demonstrated through the calendar program, emphasizing comprehensive planning and design principles.
