### Summary of Assignment 7 - CIS 3260: Introduction to Programming

#### General Purpose:
The assignment aims to develop students' understanding of fundamental programming concepts through practical implementation in Python. It focuses on function definition, error handling, and user input/output, serving as a comprehensive exercise in applying programming skills to real-world problems.

#### Main Topics Covered:

1. **Function Definition and Utilization**:
   - Students are tasked to create functions to calculate the number of days in a given year and convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This highlights the importance of function headers and bodies, as well as calling functions in Python.
   
2. **Control Structures**:
   - The assignment incorporates the use of loops (for loops) for iterating over a range of years, reinforcing the concept of control flow in programming.

3. **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**:
   - Students are instructed to document errors encountered during programming, identifying if they were syntax, run-time, or logical errors. This teaches troubleshooting skills and the significance of debugging in software development.

4. **Input/Output and User Interaction**:
   - The programs require user input and display outputs in a formatted manner. This emphasizes the importance of user interaction and data presentation in programming.

5. **System Analysis and Design**:
   - For the temperature conversion program, students must analyze inputs and outputs, designing a program flow that effectively handles the conversion logic based on user choices.

#### Critical Details:
- The assignment consists of two main programming tasks:
  1. **IA7Q1.py**: A program to display the number of days in specified years. It requires students to write and structure a function and utilize loops correctly.
  2. **IA7Q2Covert.py and IA7Q2Test.py**: Two interconnected programs that define functions for temperature conversion and utilize them effectively to interact with the user.

- Each program must follow specific naming conventions and include appropriate comments for readability, promoting good coding practice.

- Students must also submit code and documentation reinforcing the significance of organized code structure and comment usage.

- Additional objectives cover a range of programming skills including Boolean expressions, string manipulation, control flow, and function handling, providing a broad foundation in introductory programming.

In summary, this assignment encapsulates key programming principles and practices, encouraging students to engage with and apply their knowledge in practical scenarios while developing important problem-solving and coding skills.
