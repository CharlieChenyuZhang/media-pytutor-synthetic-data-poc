### Summary of CIS 3260 â€“ Introduction to Programming Individual Assignment 4

**General Purpose:**
The assignment is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts using Python while focusing on systematic problem-solving, coding best practices, and debugging techniques. It emphasizes applying mathematical formulas and using programming constructs like conditional statements and loops.

**Main Topics Covered:**

1. **Program Structure and Documentation:**
   - Importance of commenting code for readability.
   - Proper naming conventions for Python scripts.

2. **Area Calculation for Regular Polygons:**
   - Development of a calculator to compute the area of regular polygons using the formula: 
     \[ \text{area} = \frac{n \cdot s^2}{4 \cdot \tan(\pi/n)} \]
   - Tasks include system analysis, understanding inputs/outputs, and implementing calculations.

3. **Grade Conversion Application:**
   - Creation of a program to convert letter grades (A, B, C, D) to numeric values.
   - Focus on user input validation and proper handling of invalid inputs.
   - Emphasis on using conditional statements for decision-making.

4. **Leap Year and Days in a Month Computation:**
   - Development of a software that determines the number of days in a specified month of a given year, including handling leap years.
   - Includes practical application of Boolean expressions to validate the leap year condition.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - Students are required to document errors encountered during coding, categorizing them as syntax, runtime, or logical errors.
   - Emphasizing the importance of debugging and the time spent resolving issues, promoting persistence in problem-solving.

6. **Learning Objectives:**
   - Cover fundamental programming concepts including Boolean expressions, selection control structures, and using mathematical functions from the Python math module.
   - Integrate knowledge from chapters focused on logical operations, string processing, and implementing decision control structures.

**Critical Details:**
- Students must submit their Python scripts alongside a Word document summarizing their answers and experiences.
- The assignment is structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical coding experience, reinforcing concepts learned in lectures.
- Use of PyCharm is recommended for coding, directing attention to an integrated development environment familiarization.

This assignment combines core programming skills with real-world applications, ensuring students not only learn to code but also understand the underlying principles and practices essential for any programmer.
