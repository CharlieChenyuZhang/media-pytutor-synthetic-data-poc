### Summary of Week 7 Lecture: Introductory Programming Course

#### Objectives:
This week's lecture focuses on Chapter 4, targeting multiple key areas related to mathematical functions, string manipulation, and character encoding in Python. The objectives related to the lecture include:

1. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - Solve mathematical problems using built-in functions in Python.
   - Utilize the math module for advanced mathematical functions.

2. **String Representation and Processing:**
   - Process and manipulate strings and characters in Python.
   - Understand and implement character encoding using ASCII and Unicode.
   - Explore Unicode and ASCII tables.

3. **String Functions:**
   - Use functions like `ord()` and `chr()` for character representation and conversion.
   - Test for substring presence and compare strings using operators.

#### Key Topics Covered:

1. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - Introduction to built-in functions, e.g., `max()`, `min()`, `round()`, `abs()`, and `pow()`.
   - Usage of the math module functions such as `fabs()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `sqrt()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, and logarithmic functions.

2. **String Manipulation:**
   - Definition of strings as sequences of characters.
   - Representation of characters using single or double quotes.
   - Introduction to escape sequences for special characters, e.g., `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab, and `\\` for backslash.

3. **Character Encoding:**
   - Understanding ASCII (8-bit) vs. Unicode (16-bit) and their character limits.
   - Explanation of how to use `ord()` to obtain the numeric code of a character and `chr()` to convert numeric codes back to characters.

4. **String Operators and Functions:**
   - Using `in` and `not in` to test for substrings within strings.
   - Comparison of strings based on character encoding.
   - Utilization of string functions such as `len()`, `max()`, and `min()`.

5. **Practical Applications:**
   - Exercises demonstrating the use of the mathematical functions and string manipulations in real coding scenarios.
   - Discussions and problem-solving in class about practical coding challenges using the covered topics.

### Conclusion:
The lecture provided a comprehensive overview of essential programming concepts related to functions available in the Python programming language for mathematical operations and literature processing through strings. The understanding of ASCII and Unicode is critical for correctly encoding and decoding character data within programs, fostering better data handling and manipulation skills for aspiring programmers. Moreover, in-class exercises reinforced learned material through practical application. 

Students are encouraged to complete additional exercises and prepare for upcoming quizzes.
